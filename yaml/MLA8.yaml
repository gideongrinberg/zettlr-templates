# This is a new defaults file that you can use to define rules for exporting or
# importing files to and from Zettlr. The only two required properties are the
# writer and reader ones. Without them, Zettlr will not be able to export or
# import your files. You can choose any reader or writer that is supported by
# Pandoc. Zettlr will automatically show the profile at appropriate locations
# based on the values of the writer and reader properties.
# More info: https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html.
